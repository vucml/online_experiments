How to progress when experimenter check-in is prompted: Right Arrow Key

1.  **Before subject arrives** (be there 10/15 minutes early if possible to set up or in case they get there early):
    -   Unlock testing room doors, lights on, computers and monitors on
    -   Experiment started in web browser with initial Full Screen Screen mode prompt displayed.
    -   In another tab, have the demographic survey URL opened and ready to go
    -   In a third tab, have the debriefing survey URL opened and ready to go
    -   Jordan should be around most working hours and will supervise (at least) the first few sessions for each experimenter. Any issues whatsoever, call Jordan at 803-741-4741.

2. **Welcome** them into the lab
    -   Introduce yourself and check that they are here for the correct study
    -   Give them a little background:
        -    "We are interested in how people store and recall items from memory. You will be presented with a list of items. At the end of each list, there will be a recall period. Sometimes you will be asked to recall an item from a particular category, other times you will be asked to recall items in any order."
        -    "When you are asked to recall an item, it is important that you just type the item itself, and not the category label presented with it."
        -    "You will type your responses into the computer and press ENTER to submit each response. You'll have a full minute to to remember study items. Sometimes a study item will come to you after several seconds, so keep trying until the end of the minute."
        -    "We use a simple string matching algorithm to score your responses, so small typos will usually not affect your score. However, we ask that you try to type your responses into the computer as close to the presented text as you can. If you do make major typos, you can press BACKSPACE to undo individual characters or ENTER to clear your text."
        -    "You will be given feedback on your performance after each list. And at the end of the experiment, you'll be informed of a bonus payment based on your performance of up to $10."
        -    "You will be allowed to take a short break between each study and recall period. And between each study and recall period, you'll be allowed to take a short break. You will be asked to complete a few questionnaires at the end of the study. The study will take about 1 hour to complete. Do you have any questions before we get started?"

3. **Consent** form: 
    -   We will primarily record consent via paper copies. We will keep paper copies of the consent form and a set of pens in the lab. These can be used to go over the consent form with the participant and address any questions or concerns, and finally to record their consent.
    -   Script: "When the study starts, you'll be prompted to read and agree to the consent form. This form outlines that there is no risk of harm or injury in this behavioral study, that you may choose to withdraw at any time, and that there will be no audio recordings or video recordings. Proceeding consents you to take part in our study and gives us permission to use your data for our research. Do you have any questions about the consent form?"
    -   "If you have a cell phone with you, we ask that you turn it to silent"
    -   "The experiment itself will last about 1 hour. You will receive [X credits] or [X] dollars for your participation in this study"
    -   Seat them in testing room, make sure they're comfortable, etc.

4. **Once seated**; before instructions:
    -   To run the experiment, go to the URL hosting our experiment server and navigate in the UI to the corresponding experiment. Click "Run" to activate the initial page of the experiment and then "Continue" to automatically enact move the browser into Full Screen mode. The consent form should then be visible. Again this stage can be done before the participant arrives.
    -   Tell them that after consenting they will see a bunch of instructions about how to complete the experiment. You can follow-up with something like:
    -   "We know that there is a lot to take in, so once you have carefully read through the instructions, I will come back in and ask you to summarize what it is that you think you'll be doing. That way, if there's any gaps I can help fill them in for you. [friendly smile]"
    -   You will be sitting outside the testing room, watching the experiment screen and waiting for the "END OF INSTRUCTIONS. PLEASE CHECK IN" text to appear.

5. **Before** starting practice round, but after they have read the instructions, ask the subject to repeat a summary of the instructions back to you. 
   - They should roughly mention (in any order):
     -  "I will be presented with a list of items"
     -  "I will be asked to recall the items"
     -  "Sometimes I will be asked to recall items from a particular category"
     -  "I will type my responses into the computer and press ENTER to submit each response"
     -  "I will have a full minute to remember study items and should keep trying until the end of the minute"
     -  "I will be allowed to take a short break between each trial"
   -  If they miss any of these points say something like "that was great, but just one more thing is ..."
   -  "Now we're going to do a practice round to make sure you understand the instructions. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me at any time. Otherwise, I'll be right outside the door if you need anything. Once you're ready, go ahead and click the "NEXT" button on the screen and the practice round will begin."
   -  Any questions?

6. **After** practice round:
    -   Ask them if they have any questions about the experiment or if they would like to go over the instructions again.
    -   Emphasize that they should type their responses into the computer as close to the presented text as they can and to keep trying to remember items until the end of the minute. (At this point you can say something **friendly** about how our data means a lot to us and the recall answers are valuable."
    -   You can say something like: "Just as a reminder, you will have a full minute to remember the items. Sometimes a study item will come to mind after several seconds, so keep trying until the end of the minute. And we know that it's tough but but if you can try to type your responses into the computer as close to the presented text as you can, we would really appreciate it. We use a text analysis program to score your responses and it works best when the responses are as close to the presented text as possible. Thanks again for taking part in our study -- your data means a lot to us. Do you have any further questions before we get started? I'll be just outside but it is very hard to hear through this door so if you need me for any reason just come out."

7. **After** the experiment:
   - **To fully complete the experiment, you'll need to review the information on the final screen and then click the ">" button to advance to ensure that the data is saved.** This is really important!
    -   Now they need to complete a demographic questionnaire. This is to be done via redcap; the URL for the survey is at the top of this document. Explain to the participant that the questionnaire will take a couple minutes to complete and is not tied in any way to their experimental data but instead is reported separately to 1) fulfill our obligations to the funding agency and 2) ensure that they are compensated for their time. 
    -   Emphasize that their responses need to be complete and accurate to ensure their compensation.
   - Once they finish the demographic questionarre, complete the debrief/survey questionnaire for them on another tab in the browser by using the questions to interview them. This questionairre focuses on their experience in the study and helps us to improve our study for future participants as well as interpret their data.
    -   Give the participant space and privacy to complete the questionnaire but remain outside the testing room to answer any questions they may have about the questionnaire and to be ready to start the experiment when they are finished.
   - If applicable, give them the subject payment and payment form and thank them for their participation. 
   - Mark 'participated' and assign credit (for credit study) in the SONA system.
     - Go to SONA > Find study name > Study Menu > View/Adminstrator Time Slots > Modify on corresponding participant > Mark 'Participated' or 'No Show'
