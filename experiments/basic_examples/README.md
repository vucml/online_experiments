Basic examples of actual experiments that can be run using Github Pages or JATOS or Live Server.

1.	**Free Recall Experiment**: Participants study a list of words and then recall as many as they can within a time limit.
2.	**Recognition Memory Experiment**: Participants study a list of words and then are tested on their recognition of previously seen (old) words versus new words.
3.	**Image Recognition Experiment**: Similar to the recognition experiment but uses images instead of words.
