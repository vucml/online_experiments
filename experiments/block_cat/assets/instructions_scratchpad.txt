Welcome to the experiment!

In this experiment, you'll be asked to study and remember words. 


===

<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; display: inline-block;">During the study period, you will see a series of study items presented one at a time. Each study item will be presented with a category label, like this:</p><p></p><p>MUSIC STYLE</p><p>hip hop</p><p></p><p>Your goal is to remember the study item for a later memory test.</p>

===

After the entire list is presented, you will type as many study items as you can remember. Sometimes you will get a prompt that asks for an item from a particular category, and sometimes you will get a prompt that asks for any item. Here's what those prompts will look like:

Recall MUSIC STYLE
_

Recall ANY ITEM
_

===

After you type a given item, you'll press ENTER to submit it. Do your best with spelling, but don't worry too much about minor spelling errors. You will be given a full minute to remember the study items. Sometimes a study item will come to you after several seconds, so keep trying until the end of the minute.

===

If you can't remember an item that fits a given category prompt, you can type "pass" and press ENTER.

===

You'll get a little break in between trials. Take a few seconds, and when you're ready for the next trial, press SPACE. 

OK, you're ready for a practice trial! Press SPACE to start the practice trial.
