## Basics
- **[Press Any Key! Experiment](http://githubpsyche.github.io/online_experiments/experiments/basics/index.html)**. Participants press any key and the experiment ends.

## PSY2150
- **[Free Recall Experiment](http://githubpsyche.github.io/online_experiments/experiments/2150/free_recall.html)**. Participants study a list of words and then recall as many as they can within a time limit.
- **[Recognition Memory Experiment](http://githubpsyche.github.io/online_experiments/experiments/2150/recognition.html)**. Participants study a list of words and then are tested on their recognition of previously seen (old) words versus new words.
- **[Image Recognition Experiment](http://githubpsyche.github.io/online_experiments/experiments/2150/image_recognition.html)**. Similar to the recognition experiment but uses images instead of words.

## Category Targeting Experiment

- **[Category Targeting Experiment](http://githubpsyche.github.io/online_experiments/experiments/category_targeting/index.html)**. Participants study a list of words and then alternatively prompted with a category cue for a target word, or a cue to perform free recall of any word from the list.

Notes:
- Need to target recall of "new" words from list instead of "any" word if we want to avoid repeats.
- At same time, repetitions may be required for category-cued recalls if free recall already touched on the word that would be cued by category.
- Bonus logic need updating.
- Launch configuration for debugging needs to be updated to use Live Server extension. Otherwise CORS issues will prevent loading of stimuli.
