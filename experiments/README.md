- **[Free Recall Experiment](http://githubpsyche.github.io/online_experiments/experiments/2150/free_recall.html)**. Participants study a list of words and then recall as many as they can within a time limit.
- **[Recognition Memory Experiment](http://githubpsyche.github.io/online_experiments/experiments/2150/recognition.html)**. Participants study a list of words and then are tested on their recognition of previously seen (old) words versus new words.
- **[Image Recognition Experiment](http://githubpsyche.github.io/online_experiments/experiments/2150/image_recognition.html)**. Similar to the recognition experiment but uses images instead of words.
